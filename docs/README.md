# Field Book

## Introduction

Field Book is an open-source Android app used to collect data on field research plots.
When used in place of paper field books, it eliminates the need for data transcription and reduces the risk of errors.
It runs on a wide range of inexpensive hardware, allowing consumer-grade technology to be used in environments where cost and inflexibility have been limiting factors.
The source code for Field Book is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/PhenoApps/Field-Book).

## Getting Started

Field Book can be downloaded from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tracker.fieldbook) or can be installed manually from the latest [GitHub Release](https://github.com/PhenoApps/Field-Book/releases).

Field Book will display a brief introduction when you open it for the first time.
During this intro, you must accept the required permissions and choose or create a storage directory for app files.
You can also optionally enable a tutorial or load a set of sample fields and sample traits.
The screenshots in documentation are from this sample data.
