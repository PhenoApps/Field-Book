## What are the recommended devices for Field Book?

We maintain a list of [hardware recommendations](https://www.phenoapps.org/hardware/) on the PhenoApps website.
In general, Field Book is designed to work on any modern Android device.

We tend to recommend smartphones as the best choice if you will be carrying the device (lightweight), taking photos (higher image quality), or connecting to the internet in the field (mobile data).
We use [Google Pixel phones](https://store.google.com/category/phones) when developing and testing new versions of Field Book, so these are generally recommended.

In cases when screen visibility in full sunlight is a concern we recommend e-ink devices like the [BOOX Palma](https://shop.boox.com/products/palma).
