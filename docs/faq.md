How do I cite Field Book?
-------------------------

If you use Field Book for research, please cite the following journal article:

[Rife, T.W., and J.A. Poland. 2014. Field Book: An Open-Source Application for Field Data Collection on Android. Crop Sci. 54(4): 1624–1627.](http://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2013.08.0579)

How do I prepare files for Field Book?
--------------------------------------

First, consider if it's possible to import data without prepping your own custom files. Data imports that use the Breeding API (BrAPI) or files generated by a breeding database can eliminate extra work, reduce the risk of error, and bundle in useful contextual data.

If it is necessary to prepare your own custom files:

- Custom fields can be loaded by preparing a spreadsheet. The required information is detailed in the <a href="fields.md"><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="_static/icons/home/view-module.png" width="20px"></a> [Fields](fields.md) section of the docs. The app comes with a handful of sample fields that are loaded from files, so you can also look at `field_sample.csv` in the `/field_import` folder for guidance.

- Custom traits are best created directly in the app, but can be saved to and loaded from a `.trt` file. The `.trt` extension is not a special format, it is just a `.csv` file by a different name, so can be opened and edited if needed. The app comes with a handful of sample traits that are loaded from a file, so you can also look at `trait_sample.trt` in the `/trait` folder for guidance.

What filetypes are compatible with Field Book?
----------------------------------------------

Custom fields can be loaded by preparing a spreadsheet in `.csv`, `.xls`, or `.xlsx` format. For multi-sheet spreadsheets, Field Book only accesses the first sheet. 

What are the recommended devices for Field Book?
------------------------------------------------

Field Book is designed to work on any modern Android device (~10 years old or less). When making a choice between Android devices, consider where and how you will be using the app.

We tend to recommend smartphones as the best choice if you will be carrying the device (lightweight), taking photos (higher image quality), or connecting to the internet in the field (SIM slot for mobile data). Among smartphones we recommend [Google Pixel devices](https://store.google.com/category/phones) for the simplicity of their user interface (stock android), and higher than average image quality and GPS accuracy. We use Pixels when developing and testing new versions of Field Book.

In cases when screen visibility in full sunlight is a concern we recommend eink devices like the [BOOX Palma](https://shop.boox.com/products/palma).

How do I request a new feature?
-------------------------------

Field Book issues, including new feature requests, are tracked [here on Github](https://github.com/PhenoApps/Field-Book/issues).

Search the list of existing issues before making a new request. This is important to prevent duplication. If a request already exists, you add your input by making a comment. This also helps increase the issue's visiblity.

Press the "New Issue" button on the upper right side of the issues page if you confirm that the feature you have in mind hasn't been requested already. Then select "New Feature", and fill out the required fields. Be sure to include lots of detail describing what you have in mind, what problem it solves, and what alternative solutions exist.
