======================================================================

The disease rating trait format is used for collecting ratings of both disease incidence and severity. It is created with a trait name and optional
details. The incidence scale can be adjusted by editing the
`disease_severity.txt` file in the `traits` folder.

On the collect screen, buttons showing numbers between **0-100** in 5 digit
increments are used to record incidence, and **R**, **M**, and **S** are
used to record severity. For each measurement, only a single incidence
can be recorded while severity types can be combined. The `/` button
allows varying incidence rates to be recorded (e.g., heterogenous
response within a plot).
